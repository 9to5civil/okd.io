          Welcome to the all-in-one VM for
          <a href="https://github.com/openshift/origin">OpenShift Origin</a>
          , the FOSS PaaS from Red Hat. On this page you will find links to download:
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A Vagrant VirtualBox VM</li>
          <li>OpenShift client tools (oc) that match the release</li>
          <li>A document to help you run through some of the basic steps to exercise this image</li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          This image is based off of OpenShift Origin and is a fully functioning OpenShift
          instance with an integrated Docker registry. The intent of this project is to allow
          Web developers and other interested parties to run OpenShift V3 on their own computer.
          Given the way it is configured, the VM will appear to your local machine as if it was
          running somewhere off the machine.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          The OpenShift Master, Node, Docker Registry, and other pieces are running in one VM. Given
          it's focus on application developers, it should NOT be used in production. While the Vagrantfile
          only specifies 2 gigs of RAM, you can edit the file to increase this setting if you want to run
          more containers concurrently in your instance.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>WARNING:</strong> We wanted to allow developers to use any Docker image they
          want, which required us turning off some security in OpenShift. By default, OpenShift
          will not allow a container to run as root or even a non-random platform assigned userid.
          Most Docker images in the Dockerhub do not follow this best practice and instead run
          as root. As a double negative, a large majority of Dockerhub images are not patched
          for well known vulnerabilities. Therefore, please use images from Dockerhub with
          caution. We think some of the risk is mitigated because you are running OpenShift in
          a VM, but still - be careful which Docker images you run.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          <strong>NOTE:</strong> As this is based off the Origin project and not the commercial
          OpenShift Enterprise product, support is limited to community effort.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          To remove a previous installation please do the following commands:
          <ol>
            <li>Change to the directory with your Vagrantfile</li>
            <li>$ vagrant destroy</li>
            <li>$ vagrant box remove --force openshift3 {or openshift3-bootstrap}</li>
            <li>Fire up VirtualBox to make sure the VM is really deleted. If not then delete it and all the files</li>
            <li>Follow the normal installation instructions</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
