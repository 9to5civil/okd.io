Technology \u00b6 OKD.io uses the Middleman static site framework. However, this isn't the easiest technology to pick up as a working knowledge of HTML and CSS is needed to create content. However, the current technology does allow a rich user experience to be created. When trying to recruit a larger community around a project good documentation is essential, so we need to make the documentation as simple to create as possible to encourage the current community to expend the content currently available. The site also needs to provide a basic search capability, especially if we increase the amount of content. Currently a new member joining the community has to do a lot of searching to discover how to work with the community. Some technology options \u00b6 Use github as the primary source of information, so simple markdown content cam be added to the repo. OKD.io would largely remain as the landing page for the community, where a small amount of information would link to getting started resources Use an alternate static site technology, where the content can be written without extensive knowledge of HTML and CSS, such as MkDocs , which like GitHub uses a simple markdown syntax for content and allows the look and feel of the content to be customized. This site is a Proof of Technology using MkDocs , to allow the community to explore the technology and determine if it is a good fit for our needs. MkDocs Proof of Technology \u00b6 MkDocs is a good fit for a documentation site, as it: uses standard Markdown for content, but allows extensions to produce better looking content, with features such as syntax highlighting in code, tabs, admonition (information) box, image size and justification provides a rich feature set to allow customization of a site and also a community of site theme producers . It also allows individual pages to use a custom theme, so the home page can have a different look and feel. To demonstrate this I did a rough copy of the existing home page and added it to the proof of technology site Provides both site and in-page navigation which is customizable both in terms of depth and also visual layout and structure. provides a client-side full site search capability provides a live preview when creating content. Tooling can be installed and run locally or from a container The Proof of Technology site is hosted on github pages and uses github actions to automatically update the site when new content is pushed to the main branch. This should be easy to integrate with any automation needed to build and publish the site. The site also uses cSpell to do a full spell check on the content and a link checker to validate all links contained on the site (except links within code blocks), Project landing page \u00b6 Currently the proof of technology site uses a quick migration of the existing okd.io site home page.

Content and content location \u00b6 Currently there is community content in GitHub issues and discussions, in the Google group forum, on OKD.io (including the Blogs section) and also in the OKD github repository. There is no clear guidance on where to go to find specific content. We should have a clear understanding on where we have content and what each location should be used for.

The day will start with all attendees together in the \u2018main stage\u2019 area for 2 hours where we will give an short welcome and describe the logistics for the day, give a brief introduction to OKD4 itself then walk thru a install deployment to vSphere using UPI approach along with a few other more universal best practices such as DNS/DHCP server configuration) that apply to all deployment targets. Then we will break into tracks specific to the deployment target platforms for deep dive demos with Q/A, try and answer any questions you have about your specific deployment target's configurations, identify any missing pieces in the documentation and triage the documentation as we go. There will be 4 track break-out rooms set-up for 3 hours of deployment walk throughs and Q/A with session leads: vSphere/UPI - lead by Jaime Magiera (UMich) and Josef Meier (Rohde & Schwarz) Bare Metal/UPI - lead by Andrew Sullivan (Red Hat) and Jason Pittman (Red Hat) Single Node Cluster - lead by Charro Gruver (Red Hat) and Bruce Link (BCIT) Home Lab Setup - lead by Craig Robinson (Red Hat) and Sri Ramanujam (Datto) Our goal is to triage our existing community documentation, identify any short comings and encourage your participation in the OKD-Working Group 's testing of the installation and upgrade processes for each OKD release. This is community event NOT meant as a substitute for Red Hat technical support. There is no admission or ticket charge for OKD-Working Group events. However, you are required to complete a free hopin.to platform registration and watch the hopin site for updates about registration and schedule updates. We are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment at our working group meetings and events.

Then we will break into tracks specific to the deployment target platforms for deep dive demos with Q/A, try and answer any questions you have about your specific deployment target's configurations, identify any missing pieces in the documentation and triage the documentation as we go. There will be 4 track break-out rooms set-up for 3 hours of deployment walk throughs and Q/A with session leads: vSphere/UPI - lead by Jaime Magiera (UMich) and Josef Meier (Rohde & Schwarz) Bare Metal/UPI - lead by Andrew Sullivan (Red Hat) and Jason Pittman (Red Hat) Single Node Cluster - lead by Charro Gruver (Red Hat) and Bruce Link (BCIT) Home Lab Setup - lead by Craig Robinson (Red Hat) and Sri Ramanujam (Datto) Our goal is to triage our existing community documentation, identify any short comings and encourage your participation in the OKD-Working Group 's testing of the installation and upgrade processes for each OKD release.
